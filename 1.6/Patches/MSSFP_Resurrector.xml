            <description>A one-use super-dose of mechanites tuned to resurrect the dead. Administered to a corpse, mechanites repair broken-down tissues and kickstart the body back to life. Unfortunately, the resurrected sometimes come back with brain damage, blindness, or progressive psychosis, along with varying levels of insanity. Outcomes are better when the mechanites are administered to a fresher body. If a body is preserved, it can even be resurrected long after death.\n\nThe resurrected also experience limited retrograde amnesia, forgetting some recent memories and social interactions.</description>
